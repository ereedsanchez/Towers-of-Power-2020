# Towers-of-Power-2020

7 Billion people around the world still do not have access to interent. For some, it is too expensive. 
For others, market faliures with ISPs and traditional communications providers who don't see a proft margin for rural and underdevloped communities, have left many people with out connectivity. 

I was one of those people.  When living in Bluefields, Nicaragua, I was unable to get a residential internet connection even though I lived a 10minute walk from the University.  My only options where expensive (U$5 for 1GB) celular connections.  This led me to start my own rural ISP in Nicaragua, and deploy community Open Source Cellular Networks. 

In this class you will learn the modern - and not so modern technologies - used to connected the disconnected.  
This is a crash course in real world networking technologies, including long distance wifi, Mikrotik routers, Open Source GSM and Fiber PON networks. 

Students will get hands on experience with equipment now used by MicroISPs and Community Networks.   
Guests speakers, may include Peter Bloom from Rhizomatica (Indigenous GSM Networks), Jane Coffin from the Internet Society, and others who will elaborate on current trends, challenges and avenues for disconnected communities aroudn the world.
