# Towers-of-Power-2020: Community Networks Boot Camp

7 Billion people around the world still do not have access to the internet. For some, it is too expensive. For others, it's a market failure. Many traditional communications providers don't see a profit margin for rural and underdeveloped communities.

I was one of those people. When living in Bluefields, Nicaragua, I was unable to get a residential internet connection even though I lived a 10-minute walk from the University. My only options where expensive (U$5 for 1GB) cellular connections. This led me to start my own rural ISP in Nicaragua, and deploy community Open Source Cellular Networks.

Community Networks and DIY Infrastructure is now becoming a realistic alternative to the large ISPs.In this class, you will learn the modern - and not so modern technologies - used to connected the disconnected.
This is a crash course in real-world networking technologies, including long-distance wifi, Mikrotik routers, Open Source GSM, and Fiber PON networks.

Students will get hands-on experience building a Portable Network Kit and using equipment used by MicroISPs and Community Networks.

To elaborate on challenges in community networking, guests speakers, may include Peter Bloom from Rhizomatica (Indigenous GSM Networks), Jane Coffin from the Internet Society, and others who are activly involved internationally.
